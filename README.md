# Git Change Lists

> JetBrains-style Change Lists for VS Code and compatible editors

**Git Change Lists** brings the powerful change list management from JetBrains IDEs (IntelliJ IDEA, WebStorm, PHPStorm, etc.) to Visual Studio Code, Cursor, Kiro, Windsurf, Trae, VSCodium, and Google Antigravity. Organize your uncommitted changes into named lists, work on multiple features in parallel, and commit only related changes together.

## Overview

Git Change Lists transforms how you organize Git changes by introducing **change lists**—named containers that group related files together. Instead of VS Code's simple staged/unstaged binary model, you can maintain multiple logical groupings of changes simultaneously, just like in JetBrains IDEs.

### Key Features

- ✓ **Custom Named Change Lists** - Create unlimited change lists to organize your work
- ✓ **Active List Auto-Assignment** - New changes automatically go to your active list
- ✓ **Drag-and-Drop Organization** - Move files between lists with intuitive gestures
- ✓ **Patch Management** - Generate and apply patches per change list
- ✓ **List & Tree View Modes** - Switch between flat and hierarchical file displays
- ✓ **Commit Guard** - Warns when staging files from multiple lists
- ✓ **Git Integration** - Works seamlessly with VS Code's built-in Git
- ✓ **Status Bar Integration** - See your active list at a glance
- ✓ **Multi-Editor Support** - Works on VS Code, Cursor, Kiro, Windsurf, Trae, VSCodium, and Antigravity

## Why Use Git Change Lists?

### The Problem

Traditional Git workflows force you to choose between:
1. **Committing prematurely** to separate unrelated changes
2. **Using branches for everything**, even small experiments
3. **Managing a messy staged/unstaged area** with hard-to-track changes

### The Solution

Change lists let you:

- **Work on multiple features simultaneously** without premature commits
- **Organize changes by logical context**, not just file status
- **Stage and commit exactly what belongs together**
- **Isolate experimental changes** without creating branches
- **Maintain focus** by activating the relevant change list

### Coming from JetBrains IDEs?

If you're a WebStorm, IntelliJ IDEA, or PHPStorm user who's had to switch to VS Code, you've probably missed the change lists feature. Git Change Lists brings that familiar workflow to your editor, with:

- Similar UI patterns (drag-and-drop, context menus)
- Active list concept with auto-assignment
- Default list that captures unassigned changes
- Staging-based workflow that integrates with VS Code's native Git

---

## Installation

### 1. From VS Code Marketplace
1. Open VS Code, Cursor, Kiro, Windsurf, Trae, VSCodium, or Antigravity.
2. Search for **Git Change Lists** in the Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X`).
3. Click **Install**.

### 2. From VSIX File
1. Download the latest `.vsix` file from [Releases](https://github.com/maxinne-dev/vscode-git-change-lists/releases).
2. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and run `Extensions: Install from VSIX...`.
3. Select the downloaded file.

### Verification

After installation:
1. Open a Git repository
2. Look for the **Change Lists** view in the Source Control panel (SCM)
3. The default change list should appear with your uncommitted changes

For detailed installation instructions for specific editors, see [docs/INSTALLATION.md](docs/INSTALLATION.md).

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Open a Git Repository

Git Change Lists activates automatically when a Git repository is detected.

### 2. Create Your First Change List

- Click the **+** icon in the Change Lists view header, or
- Open Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and run `Git Change Lists: Create Change List`
- Enter a name like "Feature: User Authentication"

### 3. Move Files to Your List

- **Drag and drop** files from the "Default" list to your new list, or
- Right-click a file → **Move to Change List** → Select your list

### 4. Set Your List as Active

- Right-click your list → **Set as Active Change List**, or
- Press `Ctrl+Shift+L` (or `Cmd+Shift+L`) and select your list

Now any new changes will automatically appear in your active list!

### 5. Stage and Commit

- Right-click your list → **Stage Change List**
- Write your commit message in the SCM input box
- Press `Ctrl+Enter` (or `Cmd+Enter`) to commit with the guard, or click the commit button

The committed files are automatically removed from your change list.

## Core Features

### Change List Management

#### Creating Change Lists

Create named containers to organize your changes:
- Click the **+** icon in the view header
- Use Command Palette: `Git Change Lists: Create Change List`
- Enter a descriptive name (e.g., "Feature X", "Bugfix: Login", "Refactor DB")

#### Active List

The **active change list** automatically receives newly detected changes:
- Set any list as active via right-click → **Set as Active Change List**
- Keybinding: `Ctrl+Shift+L` / `Cmd+Shift+L`
- Active list is marked with a checkmark and shown in the status bar
- Only one list can be active at a time

#### Default List

The **Default** list is special:
- Always exists and cannot be deleted
- Captures changes not assigned to any other list
- Can be renamed but retains its default behavior

#### List Operations

- **Rename**: Right-click → **Rename Change List**
- **Delete**: Right-click → **Delete Change List** (requires confirmation if non-empty)
- **Stage All**: Right-click → **Stage Change List** (stages all files in the list)

### File Organization

#### Drag-and-Drop

Move files between change lists by dragging:
- Drag a file from one list to another
- Multi-select files (Ctrl/Cmd+Click) and drag together
- Visual feedback shows valid drop targets

#### Context Menu

Right-click a file → **Move to Change List**:
- See all available lists
- Select destination or create a new list inline

#### Automatic Assignment

When `autoAssignStagedFiles` is enabled (default):
- Files staged externally (via command line, file explorer, etc.) are automatically assigned to the active list
- Keeps your change lists synchronized with Git operations

### View Modes

#### List Mode (Default)

Flat view showing all files in each change list:
- Optimized for small-to-medium change sets
- Quick scanning of filenames
- Fast navigation

#### Tree Mode

Hierarchical view preserving project structure:
- Better for large change sets
- Shows directory organization
- Collapsible folders with badges showing child counts

**Toggle**: Click the tree/list icon in the view header, or use `Git Change Lists: Toggle List/Tree View`

View mode and expansion state persist across sessions.

### Git Integration

Git Change Lists extends VS Code's Git integration without replacing it:

#### Real-Time Synchronization

- Detects Git state changes automatically
- Updates change lists when files are modified, staged, or committed
- Works alongside command-line Git and other extensions

#### Staging Workflow

1. Right-click a change list → **Stage Change List**
2. All files in the list are staged
3. Use VS Code's standard commit UI (compatible with commit message extensions)
4. After commit, files are automatically removed from change lists

#### Post-Commit Cleanup

- Watches for successful commits
- Removes committed files from change lists automatically
- Keeps your change lists clean and up-to-date

### Commit Guard

Prevents accidentally committing mixed changes:

#### How It Works

When `commitGuard.enabled` is true (default):
1. Before committing, validates all staged files
2. If files are from multiple change lists, shows a warning dialog
3. Options:
   - **Unstage Extra Files**: Unstages files not in the primary list
   - **Commit Anyway**: Proceeds with the mixed commit
   - **Cancel**: Aborts the commit

#### Using the Guard

- **Via Keybinding**: `Ctrl+Enter` / `Cmd+Enter` in the SCM input box (if `commitGuard.interceptCommit` is enabled)
- **Via Command**: `Git Change Lists: Commit (with Guard)`

**Note**: The guard cannot intercept the native commit button click due to VS Code API limitations. Use the keybinding for guarded commits.

### Status Bar Integration

The status bar shows:
- Current active change list name (truncated if long)
- Full name in tooltip on hover
- Click to quickly switch active lists

Toggle visibility with `gitChangeLists.showStatusBar` setting.

### Multi-Root Workspace Support

Git Change Lists works with multi-root workspaces:
- Each workspace folder has independent change lists
- State is isolated per repository
- Seamless switching between folders

## Use Cases and Workflows

### Parallel Feature Development

Work on multiple features without premature commits:

1. Create change lists: "Feature A", "Feature B"
2. Set "Feature A" as active
3. Work on Feature A (files auto-assign to it)
4. Switch to "Feature B" as active
5. Work on Feature B (files auto-assign to it)
6. Stage and commit Feature A independently
7. Continue working on Feature B

### Bug Fix During Feature Development

Handle urgent bug fixes without disrupting feature work:

1. Currently working on "Feature X" (active list)
2. Bug report comes in
3. Create "Hotfix: Critical Bug" list, set as active
4. Fix the bug (changes go to Hotfix list)
5. Stage and commit Hotfix independently
6. Set "Feature X" back to active, continue work

### Code Review Preparation

Organize changes for clear, focused pull requests:

1. Create change lists by logical component:
   - "Refactor: Database Layer"
   - "Feature: User Profile"
   - "Docs: API Documentation"
2. Stage and commit each list separately
3. Create focused PRs from each commit
4. Easier for reviewers to understand changes

### Experimental Changes

Isolate experimental code without creating branches:

1. Create "Experiment: Performance Optimization"
2. Make experimental changes
3. If it works: commit it
4. If it doesn't: discard the entire change list
5. No branch overhead, clean commit history

### Mixed Workflows

Combine with traditional Git workflows:

- Use change lists for local organization
- Still use branches for long-lived work
- Change lists organize commits within a branch
- Commit guard prevents mixing unrelated work

---
